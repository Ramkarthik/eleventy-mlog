RSS readers used to be extremely popular. Two main reasons why it is not as popular anymore are:

1. Google killer Google Reader
2. Twitter (and to some extent, Facebook) became the primary source to find content

There are still a lot of people who use RSS readers and many companies and individuals have built Google Reader replacements.

Google Reader, and therefore its replacements, follow certain unwritten rules which have now become standard for any RSS reader:

1. Feeds can be categorized into groups (or topics)
2. Feeds will show all items along with unread count
3. Almost an inbox like update with each article being a message that you can click to view details

It will be interesting to build an RSS reader that challenges this standard.
